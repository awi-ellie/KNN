# KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors is an AI Algorithm for classification and regression. 
KNN assumes that every data point provided is closer to each other and thus plots each data point on a map to show how they relate to each other. 
The algorithm then measures the distance between data points on a graph so as to infer their relationship. KNN can be used for regression or classification applications in supervised and anomaly detection in unsupervised learning.
